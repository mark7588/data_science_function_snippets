# data_science_function_snippets
## Description: Provide snippets of python codes facilitate data analysis and creating, training and evaluating statistical models
## Inspiration: As a beginner in data science field, I had to come up with codes for data cleansing, data extracting, data analysis and so on every time I work on data analysis. I wanted to create my own library of functions that I could easily use whenever I need for data analysis. Also, I want to save time for everybody as a software engineer.
